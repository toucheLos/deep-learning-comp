Steps for the Experiment

    Load Required Modules:
        module load singularity
        module load cuda/12.2.2
        module load python/3.11.6

    Prepare the Environment:
        source venv/bin/activate
	    singularity run /dl-comp/tensorflow:20.09-tf1-py3

    Run Experiments:
        Configure and run scripts for each model with different HPC settings.
        Use nvidia-smi to monitor and adjust GPU settings dynamically.

    Record Results:
        Log training time, inference time, accuracy, resource utilization, and energy consumption for each configuration.

    Analyze Results:
        Compare the performance metrics across different configurations to determine the optimal settings for each model.
